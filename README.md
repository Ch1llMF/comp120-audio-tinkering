# comp120-audio-tinkering

I chose contract 4. This contract instructs me to build a UI and then add sound effects to this UI. Therefore to fulfill this UI I will build a functioning menu that will include multiple buttons like a play button, a settings button and a quit button. I will then create seperate scenes that these buttons, when clicked, will switch to. As well as this the buttons will emit sounds when clicked.
